                <h2 id="homeVal">Home Page Validation Report</h2>
                    <p>The HTML code had a few validation issues that were corrected. A duplicate id attribute was found, which was resolved by ensuring each ID is unique. Some headings were out of order, so the structure was adjusted for better accessibility and readability. There were also warnings about using block-level elements like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> inside <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, which is valid in HTML5 but may raise alerts in older validators. Lastly, a minor structural warning suggested wrapping the <code>&lt;header&lt;</code> in a sectioning element like <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> to improve semantic clarity.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="tableVal">Table Page Validation Report</h2>
                <p>The table page had a few minor HTML validation issues that were addressed. A duplicate <code>id="top"</code> was present in multiple pages, which was resolved to maintain unique IDs across the site. There was an empty <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> element within the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, which served no structural purpose and was removed to prevent semantic errors. Additionally, one of the table headers was missing for the first column, which originally caused a mismatch in the number of header cells and data rows. This was corrected to ensure the table structure aligned properly. Overall, these fixes improved the semantic accuracy and structural clarity of the HTML code.</p>

                <h2 id="contentVal">Hydroelectric - Content Page Validation Report</h2>
                <p>The Hydroelectric Energy content page had a few minor validation issues that were addressed. The <code>id="top"</code> appeared multiple times across different pages, so it was reviewed to ensure uniqueness where needed. Additionally, some optional attributes like <code>role</code>, <code>aria-label</code>, and <code>tabindex</code> were used for accessibility enhancement, but if misused or unnecessary, they may trigger validator warnings. The use of emoji in headings (like ‚Äúüåä‚Äù and ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è‚Äù) can occasionally result in warnings related to content readability or accessibility. Finally, the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> viewport tag and script placement were verified to ensure proper responsiveness and behavior across devices. Overall, all elements were revised to ensure semantic HTML5 structure, accessibility, and visual responsiveness.</p>
